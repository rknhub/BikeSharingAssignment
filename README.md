## General Information
- Background: BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced significant revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company aims to develop a strategic plan to boost revenue post-lockdown by understanding the demand for shared bikes.
- Business Problem: The goal is to predict the demand for shared bikes and understand the factors influencing it to devise strategies to meet demand and stand out from competitors.
- Dataset: Daily bike demand data across the American market, including factors such as weather conditions, seasons, sales data etc.


## Conclusions
Significant variables in predicting bike demand include temperature, weather conditions, seasons, and yearly trends.
### Factors Intepretation:
  - Positive Correlation:
    - Temperature: Major factor with a 0.48 coefficient, indicating higher bike usage in warmer weather.
    - The 'yr' variable, indicating years 2018 and 2019, is crucial for capturing the increasing popularity of bike-sharing services over the year.
  - Negative Correlation:
    - Humidity, Windspeed, Light Snow: These factors deter bike usage, reflecting lower sales in adverse weather conditions.
    - Seasonal and Monthly Effects: The model effectively captures variations in demand across different times of the year.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries - Pandas, Matplot, Seaborn, Statsmodel, Scikit-Learn
